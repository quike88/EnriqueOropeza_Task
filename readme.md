# Unity Prototype

## Project Description
This project is a small Unity prototype created as part of a technical task.  
The main goal is to demonstrate core gameplay systems such as player movement, interaction, combat, and an inventory system.

The objective of the game is simple: explore the village and reach the castle to meet the king.  
The focus of the prototype is not the mission itself, but the underlying systems and code structure.

## Controls

### Keyboard & Mouse (Primary)
- **Move:** W, A, S, D or Arrow Keys  
- **Camera:** Mouse  
- **Interact:** E  
- **Attack:** Left Mouse Button  
- **Use Item:** Q  
- **Open Inventory:** Tab / I / Esc  
- **Restart Level:** Hold R for 2 seconds  

### Controller Support
- Partial controller support is available for movement and camera.
- Inventory interaction is currently **keyboard and mouse only**.

This limitation was intentional to keep the scope focused on the core systems within the given time frame.

## Notes
- The project uses a simple 3D environment from the Unity Asset Store.
- The inventory system supports item stacking, swapping, equipping, and persistence.
- Save data is stored locally and restored when restarting the game.
